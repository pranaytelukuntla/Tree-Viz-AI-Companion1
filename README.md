# 🌳 Tree VIZ AI Companion

## 🌟 Inspiration  
Tree Viz AI Companion was built to bridge the gap between learning and understanding data structures, especially for students and developers who often struggle with abstract concepts. By offering real-time, dynamic visualizations of **binary trees, binary search trees, and heaps**, we aim to make learning more intuitive and engaging. The addition of a **ChatGPT-powered bot** sets it apart by offering on-the-spot explanations and guidance for learners.

## 🚀 What it Does  
Tree Viz AI Companion allows users to input arrays and instantly visualize three core data structures:

- **Binary Tree Visualization**: Users can see how a binary tree is structured from their input array.  
- **Max-Heap Visualization**: This mode visually demonstrates the process of heapifying an array into a Max-Heap.  
- **Binary Search Tree Visualization**: Users can observe the creation of a binary search tree, illustrating how the nodes are sorted.

In addition, our real-time **AI bot assistant** offers immediate feedback and explanations, making this tool more interactive and informative.

## 🛠️ How We Built It  
We used **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to create the front-end, with **D3.js** powering the data visualizations. The AI assistant is integrated with **ChatGPT**, which responds to user queries regarding node behavior, algorithmic steps, or common mistakes. 

Key algorithms are implemented in:
- **treeApp.js**: Core application logic.
- **treeNode.js**: Handles node structures.
- **heap.js**: Implements heap operations.  

This cohesive combination offers an engaging and educational experience.

## ⚠️ Challenges We Ran Into  
- **Real-time Visual Updates**: Integrating D3.js visualizations with real-time responsiveness was challenging.  
- **AI and UI Integration**: Managing the interaction between the ChatGPT bot and the visualizations efficiently required careful balancing.  
- **User Input Handling**: Ensuring smooth transitions and handling input errors gracefully were notable hurdles.

---

## 🏅 Accomplishments That We’re Proud Of  
- **Seamless AI Integration**: We successfully integrated D3.js with an AI-powered bot to provide real-time explanations.  
- **Interactive Learning**: We created a tool that not only visualizes complex data structures but also makes learning engaging.  
- **Smooth Error Handling**: Robust error management ensures a seamless user experience.

## 📚 What We Learned  
This project deepened our understanding of:
- **Visualizing Data Structures**: Using D3.js enhanced our ability to create intuitive visualizations.  
- **AI in Education**: We explored how ChatGPT can support education by answering questions and resolving doubts in real time.  
- **Optimized Algorithms**: Developing and implementing efficient algorithms for various tree structures improved our technical skills.

## 🔮 What's Next for Tree VIZ AI Companion  
- **Expand Data Structure Support**: Add support for **AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees**.  
- **Step-by-Step Animations**: Visualize tree operations in a more detailed manner.  
- **Enhanced AI Assistant**: Add in-depth explanations and interactive quizzes.

These enhancements will make Tree Viz AI Companion a more comprehensive tool for data structure education and debugging.
